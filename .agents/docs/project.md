# Project Context

Fill this document during project initialization. Agents must verify commands against repository configuration before running them.

## Overview

- Product: artel-orchestration-server
- Primary users: TODO
- Core domain: TODO
- Runtime environment: TODO

## Architecture

- Entry points: TODO
- Main modules: TODO
- Dependency direction: TODO
- External systems: GitHub repository `project-artel/artel-orchestration-server`; Jira project `ARTEL` via the `mcp-atlassian` MCP server
- Persistent data: TODO

## Commands

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Install dependencies | TODO |
| Run locally | TODO |
| Format | TODO |
| Lint | TODO |
| Type-check | TODO |
| Unit tests | TODO |
| Integration tests | TODO |
| Build | TODO |
| Set up Jira credentials | `cp .jira.env.example .jira.env` |

Jira access goes through the `mcp-atlassian` MCP server, declared in `.mcp.json`
at the repository root. Claude Code starts it on demand and asks for approval
the first time it connects.

Credentials live in `.jira.env`, which the server reads through `--env-file`.
Copy `.jira.env.example` and fill in `JIRA_URL`, `JIRA_USERNAME`, and
`JIRA_API_TOKEN`, issuing the token at
`https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens`. `.gitignore`
excludes `.jira.env`; never commit it.

The server reads that file itself, so the setup does not depend on how Claude
Code was launched or on which shell exports the variables. Do not register a
`jira` server in user scope as well, or two copies start.
